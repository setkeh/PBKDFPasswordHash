This is my First NuGet package for .NET,

This is a piece of code i actually lifted from [The Awesome People over at CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm) I strongly suggest you check out that guide if you're new to Cryptography or have never build an authentication system before.

To be Very clear i did ot write this piece of code i am only packaging it with some minor changes to the layout of Program.cs, I just find myself using it enough i felt it warrented packaging :)

Note: The library was written on linux and built with mono with no issues but should be fully windows and visualstudio compatable also.

Checkout Test.cs in the tests folder for some quick and dirty examples of how to use the package, Happy Coding.
